During this challenge, I practiced:

- Responsive design using `max-width`, `media queries`, and `flexbox`
- Styling lists and tables to match exact design (from Figma)
- Improving accessibility with correct heading levels and `alt` usage
- `list-style-position: inside;`
- table style: `  border-collapse: separate`;
  `border-spacing: 0 8px`;
  `table-layout: fixed`
